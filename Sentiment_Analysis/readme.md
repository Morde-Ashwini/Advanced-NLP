# Overview

Sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative or neutral. Project that I developed uses sentiment 140 dataset from kaggle. I have used different techniques to clear the text from dataset, trained the model, got the accuracy, precision, f1-score for the model. To do all this I have used python programming language and diffenet libraries that help built different functionality. Please find the google collab link attached.
